  Juul, Jonas S., and Mason A. Porter. “Hipsters on Networks: How a Small Group of Individuals Can Lead to an Anti-Establishment Majority.” ArXiv.org , 22 July 2017, arxiv.org/abs/1707.07187.

  Jull and Mason explored how "anti-establishment nodes (hipsters)" in a network can significantly influence the spreading of two competeting products. They designed a "hipster threshold model" which defines each node either as a conformist or as a hipster with probability <i>p_hip</i>. They ran the simulation on various types of networks including real data set like <i>Facebook 100</i> and synthetic networks such as the ER graph. They conclude that they model explains "why anti-establishment choices in elections, competing products, political candiates, can arise genetically from small number of antim-establishment individuals".

  (This seems like a Ph.D thesis, but Mason A. Porter(the professor) has more than 9000 citations on google scholar. I found this paper on Complexity Digest)
