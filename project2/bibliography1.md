Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo, and Alessandro designed a model for the spread of computer viruses on the internet. They call it the susceptible-infected-susceptible(SIS) epidemilogical model on scale-free graphs. They used the Barabasi and Albert model to generate the scale-free graph. They abstract the spreading phenomenon by defining nodes as discrete entities that are either healthy or infected. Each step, a healthy node is infected with rate 'v'(if node is connected to any infected nodes) while infected nodes cure with rate 'u'. They validated their model with a virus epidemics data for Virus Bulletin from 1996 to 2000. They conclude that scale-free networks are prone to the spreading and persistence of infectious viruses.


Helbing and Yu designed a model of the outbreak of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game.
